            Implant dentistry is the most advanced therapy available for
            replacing missing teeth. Dental implant restorations generally look,
            feel, and act like natural teeth. A dental bridge is a fixed
            (non-removable) appliance designed to replace missing teeth.

          <p>
            Patients who have been treated with implants are able to chew all
            the foods they desire. They can also correct gaps in their smile and
            are an alternative to appliances such as dentures or bridges.

          <h5 className="heading-custom-5">How Do Implants Work?</h5>
          <p>
            Implants are designed to fuse into the jawbone in place of the
            missing teeth to provide stable support for artificial teeth.
            Restorations such as dentures and dental crowns would be allowed to
            mount over it. Stable and grounded implants cause no shifting or
            slippage of restorations. Dental implants can bring you on the road
            to recovering from your lost set of teeth to feel more natural and
            energetic.

          <p>
            Implants help restore your self-esteem and bring back the confidence
            to smile like before.

            What is the Procedure to Get Implants?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Getting dental implants would involve a series of steps. Any broken
            or decayed teeth that need removal would be removed by an extraction
            procedure. In place of the missing teeth, the dentist would place
            the Titanium implant into the bone socket where the tooth is
            missing. Healing of the implant would take place in a period of six
            to twelve weeks. Once integrated with the bone, a restoration in the
            form of a crown is attached to the abutment.
