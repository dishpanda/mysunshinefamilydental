It grows if it’s\n              not removed, by feeding on food debris on the surface of your\n              teeth. As it eats, it produces toxins that can inflame your gums,\n              which is the cause of periodontal disease. Plaque is sticky and\n              almost invisible, which makes it difficult or impossible to\n              completely remove without a professional dental cleaning.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Removing tartar:</strong> Tartar is located both above and\n              below your gum lines and it can only be removed via professional\n              dental instruments. Essentially, tartar is hardened plaque that’s\n              been left on the tooth and has attached itself to the tooth.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Polishing teeth:</strong> The final step is teeth\n              polishing.

Bacteria and other organisms\n            come in when you eat, drink, and breathe. Most of the time, a\n            delicate balance is maintained in your oral ecosystem, but problems\n            can arise when certain strains of bacteria become overabundant.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When you eat carbs and sugary foods and drinks, bacteria feed on the\n            sugars, producing acids in the process.

Your dentist or oral hygienist can remove it\n            when you have a regular dental checkup and cleaning. Because tartar\n            can build up in hard-to-reach places, it’s very important to visit a\n            dentist twice a year to keep it under control.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  );\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport \"./Services.css\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-bootstrap\";\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from \"@fortawesome/react-fontawesome\";\nimport { faTooth } from \"@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons\";\n\nexport default (props) => {\n  console.log(\"Rendering Restorations\");\n\n  return (\n    <Container className=\"page-body\">\n      <h2 className=\"heading-custom-2\">\n        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTooth} /> Restorations: Fillings and Crowns\n      </h2>\n      <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4 text-muted\">\n        It’s great news that the incidence of tooth decay has significantly\n        diminished due to an increase in patient awareness.

An implant\n            consists of two parts: a titanium steel screw that is surgically\n            implanted into the bone, and a porcelain crown which sits on top of\n            the screw and effectively replaces the tooth. If you are missing\n            multiple teeth, you don’t necessarily have to get one screw\n            implanted for every tooth. Instead, you can replace multiple teeth\n            with just a couple of screws using implant-supported partial or\n            complete dentures.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Dental implants have been used successful for more than 30 years.\n            The development stage of dental implantology ended more than two\n            decades ago, and research studies have clearly established the\n            safety and effectiveness of dental implants.\n          </p>\n          <h5 className=\"heading-custom-5 text-muted\">\n            Why Dental Implants Are Superior to Bridges\n          </h5>\n          <p>\n            Dental implants are superior to bridges for several reasons. Besides\n            the fact that a bridge can’t address bone loss, a bridge may also\n            lead to problems with surrounding teeth. In a situation where a\n            tooth is lost and the adjacent teeth are shaved down for a\n            conventional bridge, the teeth that have been shaved down now have\n            to take more force because the false tooth has no supporting root.\n            Over time, this extra stress can cause problems in the abutment\n            teeth. In a study done on the average longevity of three-tooth\n            bridges, it was found that one out of every four bridges were lost\n            after 15 years. The failure rate increases with four-tooth bridges.\n            Typically, when a bridge fails, one or both of the abutment teeth\n            are also lost. Of course, had the missing teeth been replaced with\n            an implant, the neighboring teeth would not have been adversely\n            affected.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <img\n            src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525893277997-207c04d47d65\"\n            alt=\"This is a snapshot of one of the most expensive dental treatments available in dentistry today.

When a tooth’s root is lost, a process\n            of bone resorption starts to occur immediately because the bone in\n            the area no longer has any stimulation. When we place a dental\n            implant, the bone actually bonds with the titanium through the\n            process of osseointegration. Once this happens, there is no more\n            danger of bone loss or deformation.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Dental implants are also more comfortable than most other treatments\n            for missing teeth. They are definitely more comfortable than\n            dentures, which may slip, click, cause sores, or even fall out if\n            patients aren’t careful. Dentures get more uncomfortable as patients\n            age, because changes in the underlying bone make the dentures stop\n            fitting properly and patients must either get a new set or live with\n            the discomfort. Dental implants, on the other hand, truly are a\n            permanent solution that will always deliver superior comfort and\n            performance.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h5 className=\"heading-custom-5 text-muted\">\n        Are You a Candidate for Dental Implants?{\" \"}\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        You might be a candidate for dental implants if all of the following\n        apply to you:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <p>You are in good general health.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>You have healthy gums.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>You are not suffering from excessive bone loss.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>You are over 15 years old.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            You have a missing tooth or teeth and you want to eat, speak, and\n            chew normally.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        Some people think that dental implants are out of their price range,\n        this is not necessarily the case.

That’s because\n            dentures make it easier to eat and speak better than you could\n            without teeth—things that people often take for granted.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            There are two types of dentures: complete dentures and partial\n            dentures. <em>Complete dentures</em> are used when all of the teeth\n            are missing, while <em>partial dentures</em> are used when some\n            natural teeth remain. A partial denture fills in the spaces created\n            by missing teeth, providing a new chewing surface and preventing\n            other teeth from shifting.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A complete denture may be either <em>conventional</em> or\n            <em> immediate</em>. The conventional type is made after the teeth\n            have been removed and the gum tissue has healed, which usually takes\n            4 to 6 weeks. During this time the patient will go without teeth.\n            Immediate dentures are made in advance and immediately placed after\n            the teeth are removed, thus preventing the patient from having to be\n            without teeth during the healing process. Once the tissues shrink\n            and heal, adjustments will have to be made to the immediate denture.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Dentures are very durable appliances and will last many years.\n            However, they may have to be relined, remade, repaired, or\n            readjusted due to normal wear.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <img\n            src=\"https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/the-dentist-is-holding-dentures-in-his-hands-dental-prosthesis-in-the-picture-id1177914966?k=6&m=1177914966&s=612x612&w=0&h=TXxUxWnNAp74oDQa_XFTTwkiOZNSR18-lB3gVa1c27g=\"\n            alt=\"Tools used in tooth extraction are laid out on a surgical towel.\"\n          />\n          <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4 text-muted\">Reasons for Dentures</h4>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              <p>Complete Denture to replace all teeth in an arch</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Partial Denture to replace several teeth in an arch</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Avoid sunken or aged-looking facial tissues</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Improve chewing, speech, and confidence</p>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4 text-muted\">\n        What Does Getting Dentures Involve?\n      </h4>\n      <div className=\"flex-container-50\">\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            The process of getting dentures requires several appointments,\n            usually over several weeks.
