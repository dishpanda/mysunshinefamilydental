It grows if it’s\n              not removed, by feeding on food debris on the surface of your\n              teeth. As it eats, it produces toxins that can inflame your gums,\n              which is the cause of periodontal disease. Plaque is sticky and\n              almost invisible, which makes it difficult or impossible to\n              completely remove without a professional dental cleaning.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Removing tartar:</strong> Tartar is located both above and\n              below your gum lines and it can only be removed via professional\n              dental instruments. Essentially, tartar is hardened plaque that’s\n              been left on the tooth and has attached itself to the tooth.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Polishing teeth:</strong> The final step is teeth\n              polishing. During this step, your hygienist will use professional\n              dental equipment to get rid of stains that wasn’t removed during\n              your typical tooth brushing and flossing routine.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <img src={chair} alt=\"Dentist's chair.\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"flex-container-50\">\n        <div>\n          <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4\">What is Plaque?</h4>\n          <p>\n            Plaque is a sticky film that forms on your teeth every day: You\n            know, that slippery/fuzzy coating you feel when you first wake up.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Scientists call plaque a “biofilm” because it’s actually a community\n            of living microbes surrounded by a gluey polymer layer. The sticky\n            coating helps the microbes attach to surfaces in your mouth so they\n            can grow into thriving microcolonies.\n          </p>\n          <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4\">\n            The Difference Between Plaque and Tartar\n          </h4>\n          <p>\n            When plaque isn’t regularly removed, it can accumulate minerals from\n            your saliva and harden into an off-white or yellow substance called\n            tartar.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Tartar builds up along and under your gumline on the fronts and\n            backs of your teeth. Although an attentive flossing may dislodge\n            some tartar buildup, you’ll probably need to visit a dentist to rid\n            yourself of all of it.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4\">What Causes Plaque?</h4>\n          <p>\n            Your mouth is a thriving ecosystem. Bacteria and other organisms\n            come in when you eat, drink, and breathe. Most of the time, a\n            delicate balance is maintained in your oral ecosystem, but problems\n            can arise when certain strains of bacteria become overabundant.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When you eat carbs and sugary foods and drinks, bacteria feed on the\n            sugars, producing acids in the process. Those acids can cause\n            problems like cavities, gingivitis, and other forms of tooth decay.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Tooth decay from plaque can even happen under your gums where you\n            can’t see it, eating away at the support for your teeth.\n          </p>\n          <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4\">\n            What is the Treatment for Plaque?\n          </h4>\n          <p>\n            You can remove plaque by brushing and flossing your teeth regularly\n            with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Many dentists recommend electric\n            toothbrushes because they are believed to be more effective at\n            removing plaque.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Plaque that has hardened into tartar will have to be removed by a\n            dental professional. Your dentist or oral hygienist can remove it\n            when you have a regular dental checkup and cleaning. Because tartar\n            can build up in hard-to-reach places, it’s very important to visit a\n            dentist twice a year to keep it under control.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  );\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport \"./Services.css\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-bootstrap\";\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from \"@fortawesome/react-fontawesome\";\nimport { faTooth } from \"@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons\";\n\nexport default (props) => {\n  console.log(\"Rendering Restorations\");\n\n  return (\n    <Container className=\"page-body\">\n      <h2 className=\"heading-custom-2\">\n        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTooth} /> Restorations: Fillings and Crowns\n      </h2>\n      <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4  \">\n        It’s great news that the incidence of tooth decay has significantly\n        diminished due to an increase in patient awareness.

Once you’re in the\n            chair, we’ll numb the immediate area and isolate the tooth that\n            we’re going to work on. In order to access the affected tooth\n            structure, we’ll make a small access hole in the tooth. Through this\n            hole, we will remove any damaged or infected pulp from the canals in\n            the tooth’s root – that’s where the name “root canal” comes from!\n            We’ll take another set of X-rays to ensure that all the affected\n            tissue has been removed before filling the canals with a medication\n            to kill any remaining bacteria. Finally, we’ll place a filling in\n            the tooth to keep bacteria out. We often recommend that patients\n            also get a dental crown placed on top of the tooth to give it extra\n            strength and protection.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <img\n            src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3779708/pexels-photo-3779708.jpeg\"\n            alt=\"Dentist performing an oral procedure.\"\n          />\n          <h5 className=\"heading-custom-5\">Reasons for Root Canal Therapy</h5>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              <p>An abscess (or pimple) on the gums</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Sensitivity to hot and cold</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Severe toothache pain</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Swelling and/or tenderness</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Sometimes no symptoms are present</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>\n                Decay has reached the tooth pulp (the living tissue inside the\n                tooth)\n              </p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>\n                &nbsp;Infection or abscess have developed inside the tooth or at\n                the root tip\n              </p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>Injury or trauma to the tooth</p>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  );\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport \"./Services.css\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-bootstrap\";\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from \"@fortawesome/react-fontawesome\";\nimport { faTooth } from \"@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nexport default (props) => {\n  console.log(\"Rendering Extratctions\");\n\n  return (\n    <Container className=\"page-body\">\n      <h2 className=\"heading-custom-2\">\n        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTooth} /> Extractions\n      </h2>\n      <h4 className=\"heading-custom-4  \">\n        Tooth extractions are performed for a variety of reasons.
